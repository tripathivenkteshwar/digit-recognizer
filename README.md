# Digit Recognizer


Model to recognize digits with a convolutional neural network, consider LeNet-5 Architecture with some improvements viz (two stacked 3x3 <br>
filters replace the single 5x5 filters, max pooling layers inplaces of average pooling layers, ReLU activation replaces sigmoid, <br>
Batch normalization and Dropout is added)


### Dependence required:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
